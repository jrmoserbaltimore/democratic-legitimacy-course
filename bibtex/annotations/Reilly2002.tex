Reilly examines the adoption of various electoral methods in pacific island nations.  While fascinating as a whole, this paper provides an important example of electoral manipulation:  in the first election in Kiribati using the Borda Count, a coalition colluded by running two additional candidates—strategic nominees—who did not campaign and were intended to appear at the bottom of most ballots.  This changed the outcome and eliminated a strong and popular opposition party opponent.  Manipulable electoral processes are often attacked immediately when people realize they can be manipulated.
