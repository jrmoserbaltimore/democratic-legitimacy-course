Condorcet presents each argument as to why women are inferior and undeserving of the political rights of citizenship, and lays out exactly why these arguments are absurd.  He concludes that either all humans, being rational beings able to make moral decisions, have the same rights, or else no human has any rights.  Whereas Rawls claims that public reason as a concept only rejects the legitimacy of ideals which are incompatible with democracy \autocite{Rawls1997}, Condorcet states that any person ``who votes against the rights of another, whatever may be his or her religion, colour, or sex, has by that fact abjured his own'' in that to do so one must necessarily claim that no person has those rights.
