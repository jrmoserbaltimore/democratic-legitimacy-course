Green-Armytage and Tideman present theoretical methods for selecting the runoff pair, commonly known as the nominees to the general election.  This paper illustrates a number of problems in social choice theory academia, largely stemming from a primary focus on single-winner, single-round voting rules.  Their premise moves immediately to the evaluation of two-round systems as a new type of analysis; and they analyze the selection of exactly two candidates.  A two-candidate election cannot be manipulated in any way; however, their approach essentially attempts to find the proper winner under the assumptions of a one-round voting rule, and then place them against someone who will obviously lose.  This becomes meaningless.
