Spring break and visit to Public Choice Society to speak about Ranked Pairs and communicating complex voting rules to voters.

Really want to bring in Rawls's veil of ignorance in Constitutional rules.  The conversation seems to progress from policy ethics e.g. Pareto, Kaldor-Hicks, and Scitovsky's Double into Buchanan and Rawls on unanimous consent.

This extends the legitimation described by Estlund and Rawls by which a Democratic society converges toward the best result via the public discourse:  Rawls describes a single individual who is faced with the unweighted possibility of being any individual, thus carrying the concern of all individuals.  The public discourse brings all individuals together to reconcile differences, each pulling the conversation in their own direction, making a whole body which attempts to approximate this veil.

Waldron's complains about judicial review must face Buchanan's claims about Paretoization.  Perhaps from time to time the rules are objectively worse than not having them, as Waldron observes with judicial review; yet overall, in total, across their entire existence and in concert with all other rules, the rule of judicial review produces better outcomes and greater welfare for everyone, thus is overall a Pareto improvement over not having it.  Waldron relies on citing individual incidents, and does not provide a strong argument for judicial review being overall bad.
