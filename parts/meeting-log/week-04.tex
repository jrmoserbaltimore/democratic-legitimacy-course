\section{Week 4}

Discussed some of what was going on with Habermas and Waldron.  Habermas was hard for me to understand; I needed to read Rawls first, to get the foundations of what Habermas meant by ``liberalism.''

No new research assigned.  I investigated some score voting things and found interesting concepts about when voters vote ethically versus unethically.

Provided an extremely early draft of curricula.
