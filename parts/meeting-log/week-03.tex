\section{Week 3}

Received research to review.  Discussion of what kinds of things to expect from that research.

Habermass/Rawls:  Collective decision making = public forum, reasoning leading up to voting. ``Realistic utopia'' practical/politically possible (Rawls) - good-faith discussion and deliberation to reach consensus.

Waldrin/peter: procedural.  Democracy is ideal procedure, outcome is legitimate. (Kassner?)

Essland: epistemic forms of democracy, relies on condorcet.

Dixit: Mentioned a public choice book, did not look this up.

Political obligation - state rules, citizen obeys, how you implement determines if policy has authority.

I found the works of these authors to go much further than these basic concepts.
