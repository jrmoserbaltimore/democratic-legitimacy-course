I put the syllabus in order and began writing out how they connect, how each relates to the next.

In response to the discussion with Kassner about sequencing the readings, I've adjusted things and identified which readings should be before class; I'm keepign some in reserve.  Often they fit well where I put them.  For example, in Week 2 I teach knowledge and education, but the reading covering what knowledge \textit{is} is assigned for Week 3.  Chapter 2 of the Handbook of Social Choice and Voting \autocite{Heckelman2015} and Yastrebtseva's working paper on Condorcet and the doctrine of public education \autocite{Yastrebtseva2015} are assigned prior to class, as this is not useful to try to synthesize during discussion.

I've started writing my own handouts for reading, so that one covers both knowledge and what is a good collective decisionâ€”the third class's topic.  That leads into public discourse nicely.  Ethics proves difficult:  constitutional consent mentions Pareto improvements, but I need consent before ethics.  I need to divide the handout on modes of collecitve decision from the topic of ethics.

I assigned ``On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship' \autocite{Condorcet1789} to be read after the course on collective decisions and consent because I want to raise those arguments in debate during the class, and I don't want people to come prepared with all the answers.  It's also preparation for the class on ethics, preference, and welfare.

Condorcet's piece on negro slavery \autocite{Condorcet1781} has important implications for constitutional consent, with Rawls's veil of ignorance, and for ethics, due to the question of depriving slavers of their slaves without just compensation (the answer is people cannot be property, and the slavers owe compensation to those against which they have perpetrated this tyranny).

I realized I needed an entire day to discuss majority rule.  Ethics, Preference, and Welfare was to cover chapters 6, 7, and 8 concerning majority, supermajority, and a priori voting power; plus a reading on ethics covering Pareto, Kaldor-Hicks, Scitovsky's Double, the income effect, and so on; plus research papers on Condorcet and Score voting; the admission of women to citizenship; This changed the flow:  rather than Ethics, Preference, and Welfare leading
