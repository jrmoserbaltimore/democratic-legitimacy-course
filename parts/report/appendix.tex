    This reading goes with the lesson comprising the collective decision taxonomy and Constitutional unanimous consent, re Buchanan, Rawls.

    Huge topics here include the implications for basic legitimacy of women's rights, racist policies like black codes, and felony disenfranchisement.  See Condorcet \autocite{Condorcet1789}.

    The below reading goes with the lesson comprising ethics in public policy.

    It's a short discussion in class because this is raw facts, nothing to debate here.  This has important implications regarding the emancipation of the enslaved, particularly when people make the mistake of assuming emancipation deprives slavers of their property.

    The below reading goes with the lesson comprising evaluating decision methods.  It's based on chapters 4 and 5 of \autocite{Tideman2006}.

    I discovered the ebook is available through interlibrary loan, and decided to just assign those chapters.
