    Tideman and Green-Armytage explored selecting a runoff pair; Tideman (and I) both believe STV is the optimal primary, although Tideman recommends some adjustments to protect the Condorcet candidate, while I contend the Condorcet candidate cannot be identified because of ballot truncation with large numbers of candidates.

    Current elections in the United States use party primary elections, top-two, or top-five (SNTV), with plurality or instant runoff voting in the general election.  Some use plurality-runoff instead of instant runoff.  Multi-member district elections often use MNTV party primaries followed by an MNTV general election.  The electoral college uses a completely different delegate voting structure.

    I'll move the two-tier problem to Representative Democracy.

    I need to sequence majority before this and Ethics because it's fundamental under Preference and under Representative Democracy.  Ethics and Welfare brings up severe problems in majority rule regarding ethics, but then brings up welfare systems (score, borda).
