Democratic Legitimacy and Voting Theory
---------------------------------------

This repository contains curricula for a basic democratic legitimacy and
voting theory course.  I developed this course initially as an independent
study project at a university, which by the end of the semester had become an
organized mess covering the material.  Apparently this is a large and difficult
project.

While the semester is over, I must continue my work and improve upoon this.  I
have included all material here, including the research write-up.

## College Curricula

The college curricula is a 15-week course on democratic legitimacy and voting
theory.  It started as a basic social choice theory course; Dr. Kassner
directed me to include democratic legitimacy as part of my independent study
project.  It is a philosophy course, notably in that the teaching style should
be to engage students in debate and discourse centered around the concepts
learned in each method, rather than lecturing and testing continuously.

I chose a teaching method based on a hostile debate approach I use, where I
predict what wrong arguments people will try to use and then lead them into
doing so.  In other words:  students are encouraged to discuss and produce
insights into things they can't actually get right without the knowledge to be
taught later in the course (even a few minutes later), and those insights will
be predictably wrong.  I expect that won't last long, since they'll start to
think harder before making claims, and will probably start assembling more
complex concepts themselves.  Always, always draw the class into agreement so
you're not battering one isolated student—make sure they all can't deny they
were all taken in.

This approach engages students and makes them suspicious of gaps in their
knowledge.  The end goal is a defense against tyranny:  students should
immediately distrust anything claiming to be democratic, and anything claiming
to be *more* democratic, digging in with the tools they have to make sure
they're not getting fleeced.  They should be able to identify when the current
system is terribly broken, and when a proposed new system is still broken.
If a society without education is only tyranny feeding on ignorance, then the
only way to protect democracy is to make people hostile toward anything that
erodes their democratic rights and give them the tools to understand when
their democratic society isn't really so democratic.  The first part is easy:
people are *already* hostile toward anything that harms their right to vote.

The 15-week course has 13 lessons because spring or fall holidays cover one
week, and I only leave one day unused.  Take-home exams or short essay finals
fit this course well:  it's not intended to teach students to recite the inner
workings of Meek's method of Single Transferable Vote or quote Plott's Majority
Rule Equilibrium Theorem from memory by name; it's intended to give a framework
for thinking about democratic elections.  Assess students on their ability to
speak (write) coherently on the subject, not on their ability to perfectly
recite memorized facts and figures.

The first lesson opens by drawing students into declaring what they think
about how we elect people—who should win an election, what democracy means—to
coax out things like "most votes wins" and mentions of "the majority."  This
is a trap:  it's easily demonstrated that all but one candidate in any election has *a* majority (*the* majority is a meaningless term), and a demonstration of
instant ruloff voting tears down these misconceptions.

The second lesson is a brief history of social choice theory.  This covers the
repeated rediscovery of the science, emphasizing that without proper education,
the theories vanished entirely.  It also lays some groundwork about Condorcet
managing to get slavery banned until some crank named Napoleon decided to make
negro slavery great again, and addresses the philosophical basis of knowledge.

The next lessons focus on democratic legitimacy.  This includes epistemic
theories of democracy, supported by Rawls's theory of public discourse, and
covered by Estlund and Habermas (I found Habermas far too dense for students
who aren't philosophy majors).  Constitutional consent covers Buchanan-Tullock
theory and Rawls's veil of ignorance, used to explain how Constitutional rules
achieve unanimous consent.

Majority rule and preferential voting builds on this.  Tournament sets such as
the Generalized Top-Choice Assumption (GETCHA), called the Smith Set, and the
Condorcet winner in particular bring together epistemic democracy.  When two
majorities exist, one preferring candidate `C` to `X`, and the other preferring
`C` to `Y`, in an election between three candidates, then `C` is the Condorcet
winner.  If we consider Rawls's veil of ignorance and the public discourse,
this intersection of majorities represents the differing possible standings in
society in which a person may find themselves, and the Condorcet result
approximates the result from behind the veil wherein a person's discourse
*with themselves* considers their needs in the event they quickly discover they
are in any of these possible socioeconomic positions.

One of the important aspects of the veil of ignorance is that a person, not
knowing if they are black or a woman, would not sign the U.S. Constitution of
1789 without provisions prohibiting slavery and enfranchising blacks and women.
As a plantation owner, it may be inconvenient to pay workers instead of abusing
slaves; as a slave, one faces intolerable and inescapable tyranny.  Given the
dice roll, it is much less bad to pay workers with good minimum wage and worker
protection laws than it is to be a slave.  Democracy's epistemic goal is to
simulate *that*.

This quickly raises considerations about universal enfranchisement, including
problems like felony disenfranchisement.  We didn't let felons vote because
they broke the rules society laid down by the consent of those governed by the
rules?  Well now everyone thinks locking people up for marijuana use is a bad
idea.  Do you know who thought it was a bad idea first?  People who got locked
up for minor marijuana possession, also major drug traffickers.  This concept
is gaining momentum through campaigning and advocacy, i.e. the *public
discourse*, and so the group supporting legalization is getting bigger and
approaching a majority.

That is how this course is built:  these prior concepts support later concepts.
Ethics and welfare in policymaking tie into democratic legitimacy and
Constitutional consent.  Representative democracy has implications for the
public discourse.  Single- and multi-winner voting rules and electoral systems
built from these determine whose vote actually matters.  The structure of
government can be built around social choice, and is heavily affected by the
manner of voting used.

I cap this course off with a lesson discussing electoral manipulation—tactical
voting and strategic nomination, selection of ballot questions, and so
forth—and an examination of propaganda from voting reform advocates.  Students
should be able to spot logical inconsistencies and apply their knowledge to
the arguments given.  This means not just parroting back what they've read in
class, but actually using that knowledge to understand and explain why
something is or is not correct—and even when the assertions are correct, the
explanations used to support them may be bizarre and twisted (third axiom of
knowledge:  you only know something if you have *good reason* to believe it's
true).

This is the best I can do in 13 weeks of instruction, but it's sufficient.  The
course is mean for students who are not interested in math, and who are not
philosophy students, and who have no background in anything.

## High School Civics

The high school civics course covers a 180-day academic calendar spanning 40
weeks.  This includes two 1-week vacations.

This is actually more difficult.  Timing lessons for ninth grade students in a
much larger curriculum is not so similar to timing lessons week by week.  It's
not about what topic is taught in a given lesson, but how many *days* we need
to address that topic.  Classes are in 45-minute increments, so a topic is
broken down into multiple lessons.

The civics course covers the same material as the college course; it also folds
in United States government and history.  The teaching style for the college
course is that of a philosophy course, centered around debate and discusison
among students and the instructor.  In high school, the instructor will likely
need to lecture more, rather than drawing the students into debate to
formulate complex concepts.

In rough:

* This civics course begins with the same sort of approach to breaking down
majority rule, but as a lecture rather than the more hostile debate approach
I use in the college course.
* The early lessons up to constitutional consent come first.
* **The course diverts into civics to build on these**
  * The Declaration of Independence is in large part about consent
  * The Constitution and its manner of passage raises a lot of questions about
    how we can be bound by such laws
  * Rawls's veil of ignorance comes into play *heavily* with the U.S.
    Constitution, and underscores the major faults in allowing slavery and not
    confering voting rights to all
  * This is a good place to insert Condorcet's reflections on negro slavery and
    his essay on admitting women into full political rights
* Majority rule and preferential voting are covered next
  * Current electoral processes are covered here, including plurality and IRV
  * National popular vote is examined against the electoral college
  * The public discourse comes into play when examining preferential voting,
    Black's Median Voter Theory, and Plott's Majority Rule Equilibrium
    Theory.  These two theories in particular illustrate a huge shift in the
    decision of the group—a change in the outcome of the public discourse—when
    eliminating black and women voters.
  * The Virginia and Kentucky resolutions, and Alexander Hamilton's response in
    The Examination VIII, are examined, particularly Hamilton's suggestion that
    immigrants who become residents need to "learn the principles and imbibe
    the spirit of our government" before they are to be allowed to vote.  This
    has implications when placed against the function of public discourse in
    democracy, and is echoed today by conservative sentiments that foreign
    immigrants will bring foreign ideals and do harm to the United States
    with their culture.
* Representative democracy is moved up ahead of Ethics and Welfare.
* Government structure is moved ahead, too
  * This enters a study of the construction of the U.S. government and the
    State governments
  * Excerpts from the Federalist Papers are relevant here
  * Supermajority rules, both in the Constitution and in Senate rules, are
    examined.  The filibuster is particularly interesting, and is examined
    here as well as in the college course
* Single- and multi-winner voting rules come into play after this
  * This extends the government structure discussion with modern debates, such
    as over single- versus multi-member districts, particularly with MNTV and
    STV
* Manipulation of voting rules is added in at this point, tying that part
  together, rather than at the end.
* Ethics and welfare follow, bringing in the history between Condorcet and
  Borda, and recalling Buchanan-Tullock and Rawls's veil of ignorance backing
  Constitutional consent.
  * Condorcet's reflections on negro slavery are relevant here, particularly
    that there is no compensation owed to slavers because people are not
    property and we do not compensate thieves when we return stolen property to
    its rightful owners
  * The income effect should be particularly interesting when dealing with
    ninth graders.

This will be reordered around a focus more on the study of the U.S. government,
researching particularly from the direction taken by
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-government-and-politics)
(which may be the recommended core of the course) and expanded with more study
of the Civil war, the civil rights movement, things like black codes and school
segregation, and other important parts of America's history relevant to our
government, the legitimacy of our democracy, and the consequences of selection
of the voting rule.
